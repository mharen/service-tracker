# Project Status

More to come...

**You would be well advised to avoid this project for now :)**

-----------------

# Who

I'm Michael Haren. You can find out more about me elsewhere. Try Google. Or Bing.

# What

This is a dreadfully simple invoice tracking application. In its current state, it is directly
targeted torwards a very specific customer and is unlikely to be very useful to others.

Eventually, it may evolve into something a little more generic.

# Where

As soon as I actually get around to implementing auth I'll post a public link.

# Why

My dad own's a company and he needed some tracking software. It didn't exist
([as far as I know](http://webapps.stackexchange.com/q/22649/694)) so I wrote it myself.
 
# How

- ASP.NET MVC
- SQL Server
- jQuery + plugins + UI
- Entity Framework + Code First
- HTML5 Boilerplate
- DotNetOpenAuth

Most of the above awesmeness is included via Nuget.

# License 

I have not decided what license this project will be held under. Until then 
I will leave it in the "you can't take this yet" state. If you really want it,
send me a [tweet](https://www.twitter.com/mharen) or email (twitter handle, @gmail)
and I'll make up my mind that much more quickly!

The world is awesome.
